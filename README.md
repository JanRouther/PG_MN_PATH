# PG_MN_PATH
It's a project for Numerical Methods classes made in 2020

Project is containg a report describing used methotds and results, note that the report is in polish.

Given .csv type files with information about points along a route with coressponding altitude make a chart of altitude versus distance.
Next choose part of these points and interpolate altitude of remainig points also make a chart and use two methods - splines and polynomial interpolation.
You are free to decide how to choose these points.
Compare results.
